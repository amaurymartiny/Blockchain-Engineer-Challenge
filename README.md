# Blockchain Engineer Challenge

This challenge consists of adding a new functionality to a simple Cosmos SDK module, `x/blog`.

`x/blog` is a Cosmos SDK module specifically created for this challenge, and allows to run a decentralized blog.

## The Challenge

In this repo, `x/blog` allows users to create blog posts, and to list all existing blog posts. The challenge consists of adding comments to `x/blog`: we want users to be able to comment on those blog posts.

Concretely, we would like to see the following components added:

- The addition of a new `Msg` service method called `CreateComment`. This method's input should take:
  - `postId` as string,
  - `author` as string (Bech32-encoded address),
  - `body` as string.
- New comments should be persisted to the blockchain state. A comment cannot be inserted into state if its corresponding `Post` does not exist in state.
- The addition of a new `AllComments` gRPC query method. This method's input should take a `postId` (a string), and returns all the comments on a post.
- The addition of two CLI subcommands, `tx create-comment` and `query list-comments`, which call the `CreateComment` and `AllComments` service methods under the hood.

## Getting Started with `x/blog`

A good place to start learning about `x/blog` is the [`./proto/blog/v1`](./proto/blog/v1) folder. It contains 3 files:

- `common.proto`: defines the shared messages that may be used in other files. We define inside it a `Post`, which represent a blog post. The `id` field is a string that represents an UUID, and the `author` field is a bech32-encoded address.
- `query.proto`: defines the `Query` service, or how to query the state. It contains for now a single method that allows to query all posts.
- `tx.proto`: defines the `Msg` service, or how to handle state transitions. It contains for now a single method that allows to create a new `Post`.

```bash
x/blog
    |- client/
        |- cli/             # CLI commands related to x/blog
    |- module/              # Implementation of AppModule, so that x/blog can be wired up to the app.
    |- server/
        |- msg_server.go    # `Msg` server: handling state transitions. Its defines the implementation of the `Msg`
                            # service defined in `./proto/blog/v1/tx.proto`.
        |- query_server.go  # `Query` server: querying state. Its defines the implementation of the `Query` service
                            # defined in `./proto/blog/v1/tx.proto`.
    |- codec.go
    |- keys.go              # Prefix keys used in the store.
    |- requests.go
    |- *.pb.go              # Files generated by gogoproto
```

If you modify the `./proto/blog/v1/*.proto` files and wish to re-generate the associated `*.pb.go` files, run the script `./script/protocgen`.

## Build and Run the Node (Optional)

If you would like to build the node to be able to test it, just run `mkdir build && go build -o ./build ./...`. A new binary will be created under `./build/regen`.

To run the node, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/run-node/).

## Resources

- Cosmos SDK Documentation: https://docs.cosmos.network/master/. Be sure to use the `/master` prefix, as the docs on `/` are for 0.39. Also, documentation for 0.40 is still work in progress, so there might be outdated content.
- Having a look at how existing modules are implemented can help. Here are the modules we're currently maintaining inside `regen-ledger`: https://github.com/regen-network/regen-ledger/tree/master/x.
- Ask us questions! Shoot us an email, or talk to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/stujhkkhvk), if you need help.

## Submission

For submission, please send us an email with a link to your project, ideally as a Github repo. Oh, and don't forget to add a nice README.md so we know how to build & run it :)
